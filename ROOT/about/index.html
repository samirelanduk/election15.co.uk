				<h2>The 2015 UK Election</h2>
				<p>This general election took place on Thursday 7<sup>th</sup> May, 2015. Prior to the exit polls, it had been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/06/general-election-2015-britain-heading-for-hung-parliament">widely assumed</a> that the election would yield a hung parliament, as had been the case five years earlier - in that case resulting in the formation of a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition.</p>
				<p>As it happened, a slim Conservative majority was achieved. The election was also notable for the SNP landslide victory in the Scottish constituencies, and for the collapse of Liberal Democrat support. UKIP also fared well, though their share of the popular vote greatly exceeded their share of the seats in parliament. This, and other similar disparities, led to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32786750">calls</a> for more proportional representation.</p>

				<h2>This website</h2>
				<p>This project began life as just an <a href="http://samireland.com/election">election simulator on samireland.com</a>, and grew from there. All voting data is from the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies">BBC website</a>, extracted with a Python web scraper and stored in an SQlite relational database. The site is JSP-based - all code is available to view on <a href="https://github.com/samirelanduk/election15.co.uk">GitHub</a>.</p>
